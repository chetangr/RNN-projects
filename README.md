For the first part:
Used real market data in order to predict future Apple stock prices using a LSTM network architecture RNN model, with both training and testing error lesser than 0.02.
For the second part:
I implemented Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to create an English language sequence generator capable of building semi-coherent English sentences by building them up character-by-character.
